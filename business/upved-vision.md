# UPVED: The Haryana-Vedic Ecclesiastical Roadmap
**Universal Project for Vedic Energy Dynamics** **Lineage: Brahmavarta / Kurukshetra Tradition** **Version 1.1 // Fiscal Year 2025**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Mission Statement
To revive the **Purushartha** (valorous action) of the ancient **Brahmavarta** region (modern-day Haryana). We bridge the gap between ancient Vedic energy dynamics and modern life through the dual disciplines of **Agni** (Sacred Fire) and **Urdhva** (Upward Kinetic Energy).

### The UPVED Distinction
Unlike traditional Vedanta societies which prioritize intellectual contemplation (**Jnana**), UPVED is rooted in the **Karma-Kshetra** (Field of Action). We represent the **Haryana-Vedic** spirit: direct, grounded, and physically disciplined—transforming the "grind" of Silicon Valley into a spiritual **Kurukshetra**.

### Legal & Classification
* **Status:** 501(c)(3) Church (IRS Section 170(b)(1)(A)(i)).
* **Governance:** The **Synod of Archers** (Ecclesiastical Council).

## 2. Sacred Geography: The Haryana Connection
*To satisfy IRS Point #5 (Distinct Religious History), UPVED claims the specific lineage of the Haryana region.*

* **The Brahmavarta Origin:** Haryana is the sacred land between the Saraswati and Drishadvati rivers where the Vedas were compiled.
* **Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra:** We teach the "Philosophy of the Field," where every action is a ritual and every challenge is a meditation on the Bhagavad Gita.
* **The Haryanvi Spirit:** We incorporate **Siddha-Vani** (Direct Wisdom) and the **Akhada** (traditional training hall) culture to build a community of "Warrior-Sages".

---

## 3. Liturgical Pillar: The "Services"

### A. The Inward Path (Weekly Worship)
**The Sunday Havan (Agnihotra):**
* **Schedule:** Every Sunday, 10:00 AM – 11:30 AM.
* **Description:** A traditional Haryanvi-style fire ritual. This satisfies the "regular religious services" requirement.
* **Theology:** The fire is the mouth of the Divine; our offerings are the purification of our intent.

**Siddha-Vani (Dharma Discourse):**
* **Content:** Practical applications of the Vedas, emphasizing the **Kshatriya** virtues of Haryana: discipline, honesty, and physical vitality.

### B. The Outward Path (Kinetic Fellowship)
**Rocketarm (The Rite of Urdhva Kanduka):**
* **Concept:** A modern "Vedic Akhada" practice where the vertical throw serves as a meditation on **Ekagrata** (one-pointed focus).
* **Compliance Note:** Framed as "Fellowship/Kinetic Worship" to distinguish from secular sports.

**Wellness Parikrama:**
* **Description:** Mindful walks connecting the Prana of the devotee with the Prakriti of San Mateo.
