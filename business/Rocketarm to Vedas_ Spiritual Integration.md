# **Strategic Ecclesiastical Transition Report: The Theological and Operational Integration of Urdhva Kanduka Vidya (Rocketarm) into the UPVED Non-Profit Framework**

## **1\. Executive Introduction and Strategic Scope**

The contemporary landscape of religious non-profit organizations is evolving rapidly, moving beyond traditional congregational models toward "activity-based" or "somatic" spirituality. In this context, the entity known as UPVED (Universal Project for Vedic Energy Dynamics) seeks to transition from a secular non-profit status to a recognized 501(c)(3) church classification. The core activity of the organization—"Rocketarm," or the discipline of vertical ball throwing—presents a unique challenge for this transition. While the activity is physically demanding and empirically measurable, it risks being classified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a recreational or commercial sports enterprise rather than a religious undertaking.

To successfully navigate this transition, UPVED must fundamentally reframe its central activity not as a sport, but as a liturgical rite rooted in ancient Vedic philosophy. This report provides a comprehensive, exhaustive analysis of the theological, legal, and operational strategies required to achieve this. We propose the reclassification of "Rocketarm" as *Urdhva Kanduka Vidya*—the Science of the Upward Sphere. By synthesizing the etymological roots of Vedic scripture, the biomechanics of projectile motion, and the regulatory requirements of the IRS "14-point test," this report establishes a robust framework for UPVED’s recognition as a legitimate ecclesiastical body.

The following analysis is divided into four primary sections:

1. **Theological Exegesis:** A deep-dive reconstruction of the "Rocketarm" practice using Sanskrit epistemology, linking it to *Upaveda*, *Dhanurveda*, and *Urdhva Gati*.  
2. **Regulatory Compliance:** A detailed legal strategy addressing the IRS definition of a church, specifically mitigating the risks of "substantial non-exempt purpose" associated with sports ministries.  
3. **The Science of Liturgy:** An examination of the physics and biomechanics of the vertical throw, framed as spiritual technology (*Yantra*) and measured with "oracle" grade precision.  
4. **Operational Business Plan:** A blueprint for the financial, infrastructural, and risk-management structures necessary to operate a "gym" as a "sanctuary."

**2\. Theological Reconstruction: The Vedic Nexus of Urdhva Kanduka**

The primary obstacle to UPVED’s church status is the perception of its core activity as a secular game. To satisfy the IRS requirement for a "recognized creed and form of worship" 1, we must demonstrate that the vertical throw is an inherent, historically grounded aspect of Vedic spiritual practice. This section serves as the theological constitution for UPVED.

### **2.1 The Concept of Upaveda: Reclaiming Applied Knowledge**

The term "UPVED" itself serves as the first theological anchor. It is phonetically and semantically linked to *Upaveda* (Sanskrit: उपवेद), which translates to "subsidiary knowledge" or "applied science".2 In the classical Vedic tradition, spiritual knowledge (*Para Vidya*) was not divorced from technical skill (*Apara Vidya*). The *Upavedas* are technical treatises associated with the four primary Vedas, designed to apply spiritual principles to physical disciplines.

The four canonical *Upavedas* are:

1. **Dhanurveda (Archery/Warfare):** Associated with the *Yajurveda*.2  
2. **Gandharvaveda (Music/Dance):** Associated with the *Samaveda*.2  
3. **Ayurveda (Medicine):** Associated with the *Atharvaveda* or *Rigveda*.3  
4. **Sthapatyaveda (Architecture):** Associated with the *Rigveda* or *Atharvaveda*.2

UPVED posits that *Urdhva Kanduka Vidya* ("Rocketarm") is a modern restoration of the principles found in *Dhanurveda*. Historically, *Dhanurveda* was not merely about killing; it was a discipline of mental focus (*Dharana*), breath control (*Pranayama*), and the mastery of external instruments to reflect internal states.6 The archer’s focus on the target is analogous to the yogi’s focus on the divine.

In the modern context, the bow and arrow—weapons of war—are replaced by the *Kanduka* (ball), a sphere representing the self (*Atman*). The vertical throw retains the ballistic mechanics of archery but redirects the trajectory from the horizontal (worldly conflict) to the vertical (spiritual ascent). Thus, UPVED defines itself as a school of *Neo-Dhanurveda*, preserving the spiritual discipline of the warrior caste (*Kshatriya*) without the violence.4 This classification allows UPVED to claim a "distinct religious history" 1 by citing thousands of years of Vedic martial philosophy as its antecedent.

### **2.2 Urdhva: The Theology of Vertical Ascent**

The directional orientation of the "Rocketarm" throw—strictly vertical—is its defining theological feature. In Sanskrit, the word *Urdhva* means "upward," "erect," or "above".8 This term is ubiquitous in yogic terminology (e.g., *Urdhva Mukha Svanasana* or Upward-Facing Dog, *Urdhva Dhanurasana* or Upward Bow) and signifies a movement against the "gravity" of material conditioning.

#### **2.2.1 Urdhva Gati and the Movement of Doshas**

In Ayurvedic and Yogic philosophy, the movement of energy in the body is described as *Gati*. *Urdhva Gati* refers to the upward movement of the vital airs (*Vayu*) or biological humors (*Doshas*).10 While *Urdhva Gati* can refer to pathological upward movements (like vomiting) in a medical context 12, in a spiritual context (*Adhyatmika*), it refers to the ascent of the *Kundalini* energy or the *Udana Vayu* (the upward-moving breath).13

*Udana Vayu* is located in the throat and head; it governs speech, expression, and spiritual growth. It is the force that facilitates the separation of the astral body from the physical at the time of death and leads the soul to higher planes.14 By engaging in the forceful vertical throw, the UPVED practitioner is physically stimulating the *Udana Vayu*, creating a somatic metaphor for the soul's liberation. The ball, released at the point of maximum extension, rides the *Udana* current into the sky.

#### **2.2.2 Urdhvamulam: The Roots Above**

The theological justification for the vertical throw is further cemented by the metaphor of the *Ashvattha* tree found in the *Bhagavad Gita* (Chapter 15, Verse 1\) and the *Katha Upanishad*. The scripture describes an eternal banyan tree called *Urdhvamulam adhah-shakham*—"with roots above and branches below".16

ūrdhva-mūlam adhaḥ-śhākham aśhvatthaṁ prāhur avyayam  
"They speak of an eternal Ashvattha tree with its roots above and branches below." 18

In this metaphor, the "roots" are in *Brahman* (the Absolute, the Highest Heaven), and the "branches" grow downward into the world of matter (*Prakriti*). Human beings, entangled in the leaves (sense objects), usually move downward or horizontally along the branches. The act of "Rocketarm"—throwing the ball strictly upward—is an act of *Pratiprasava* (involution) or returning to the source. It is a rebellion against the "downward" flow of material attachment. The thrower stands on the earth (the branches) and sends the sphere toward the sky (the roots), bridging the gap between the created and the Creator.

### **2.3 Kanduka Krida: The Historical Precedent of Sacred Play**

To avoid the IRS classification of the activity as purely "recreational," UPVED must highlight the historical religious significance of ball games in India. The Sanskrit term for "ball play" is *Kanduka Krida*.19

Ancient texts document *Kanduka Krida* not merely as leisure, but as a refined art form and a festival activity often associated with the divine.

* **Literary References:** The *Dasakumaracarita* (The Tale of the Ten Princes) and *Harivamsa* describe intricate ball games played by princesses and deities.20 The ball (*Kanduka*) was often made of wood or pith and covered in colorful cloth, symbolizing the play of the *Gunas* (modes of nature).  
* **The Divine Game:** In the *Puranas*, the universe itself is often described as a ball in the hands of the Divine. The interaction between Shiva and Parvati often involves games of dice or ball, symbolizing the cosmic dance of creation and destruction (*Lila*).22  
* **Temple Sculpture:** Devanganas (celestial nymphs) are frequently depicted in temple sculpture playing with balls (*Kanduka-Krida*), signifying joy and the playful nature of the liberated spirit.21

UPVED frames its modern practice as a revival of this sacred *Kanduka Krida*. The "game" is not a competition against others, but a ritual reenactment of the cosmic play. The ball is the *Jiva* (soul), and the thrower is the *Ishvara* (controller), attempting to liberate the soul from the gravity of *Karma*.

### **2.4 Cosmological Mapping: The Seven Lokas**

A critical aspect of UPVED theology is the mapping of the vertical trajectory to the Vedic cosmology of the fourteen worlds (*Lokas*). Specifically, the seven upper worlds (*Vyahrtis*) serve as the "stations" of the throw.23 This transforms the measurement of height from a secular metric (meters/feet) into a spiritual metric (planes of consciousness).

**Table 1: The Cosmological Stratification of the Vertical Throw**

| Sanskrit Loka | Traditional Vedic Meaning | UPVED Liturgical Equivalent | Altitude Zone (Metaphorical) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Bhuloka** | The Earth Plane. The realm of physical matter and sensory attachment. | **The Stance & Release:** The practitioner is grounded, battling the inertia of the body. | 0 \- 2.5 meters (Release Point) |
| **Bhuvarloka** | The Atmospheric Plane. The realm of *Prana* (breath) and spirits. | **The Ascent:** The ball overcomes gravity. The phase of kinetic energy transfer. | 2.5 \- 10 meters |
| **Svarloka** | The Solar/Heavenly Plane (Indra's Abode). Realm of the mind (*Manas*). | **The Stabilization:** The ball travels cleanly through the air, resisting drag. | 10 \- 20 meters |
| **Maharloka** | The Plane of Greatness. Realm of Saints/Sages (*Rishis*). | **The High Throw:** Achieved only through discipline (*Tapas*). Represents the intellectual sheath (*Vijnana*). | 20 \- 30 meters |
| **Janaloka** | The Plane of Creativity/Generation. Realm of Bliss (*Ananda*). | **The Zone:** The ball enters the upper atmosphere of human potential. | 30 \- 40 meters |
| **Tapoloka** | The Plane of Austerity/Heat. Realm of pure energy. | **The Maximum:** The theoretical limit of the throw. The "burning" of karma through effort. | 40 \- 50 meters |
| **Satyaloka** | The Plane of Truth (Brahma's Abode). The Ultimate Reality. | **The Apex (*Agra*):** The point where $V\_y \= 0$. Absolute stillness. The Unreached. | 50+ meters (The Infinite) |

In the UPVED liturgy, the "score" is irrelevant; what matters is the *Loka* pierced by the intention of the thrower. The "Apex" (*Agra* or *Koti*) 27 is the holiest moment. At the exact top of the arc, the ball is momentarily weightless—freed from the "gravity" of the lower worlds. This millisecond of suspension is the *Bindu* (point) of meditation.

## ---

**3\. The Science of Liturgy: Physics as Theology**

UPVED distinguishes itself from vague "new age" spirituality by embracing the "Science" component of *Upaveda*. We utilize the physics of projectile motion not as a secular analysis, but as a theological framework—"God's Laws written in Calculus." This satisfies the modern yearning for empirical spirituality while deepening the Vedic connection (as the Vedas are often claimed to contain scientific truths).29

### **3.1 The Physics of Verticality and "Karma"**

The motion of the *Kanduka* is governed by Newton's equations of motion, which UPVED interprets as the laws of *Karma* (Action and Reaction).

The Equation of Ascent:

$$H\_{max} \= \\frac{v\_{0y}^2}{2g}$$

* **$v\_{0y}$ (Initial Vertical Velocity):** This represents *Sankalpa* (Will/Intention). It is the energy the soul generates to break free from the cycle of rebirth.  
* **$g$ (Gravity):** This represents *Maya* (Illusion) or *Raga-Dvesha* (Attachment/Aversion). It is the constant, relentless force pulling the soul back to *Bhuloka* (Earth).31  
* **$H\_{max}$ (Height):** This represents *Punya* (Merit).

**Theological Insight:** No matter how hard one throws (effort), gravity (karma) eventually wins, pulling the ball back down. This illustrates the futility of purely physical effort and the need for *Moksha* (liberation), which is represented not by the ball returning, but by the intention remaining at the apex.

### **3.2 Aerodynamics and the "Vayu" Winds**

The Vedas describe 49 types of winds or *Maruts*, and five primary *Prana Vayus*.32 UPVED integrates aerodynamics into this Pneumatology (theology of spirit/breath).

The drag force ($F\_d$) acting on the ball is:

$$F\_d \= \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 C\_d A$$

* **$\\rho$ (Air Density):** The density of the material world.  
* **$C\_d$ (Drag Coefficient):** The "spiritual friction" of the ego. A smooth, perfect sphere has a lower $C\_d$. Thus, the *Kanduka* must be kept pristine, symbolizing the purification of the heart (*Chitta Shuddhi*).  
* **Spin and Magnus Effect:** In baseball or cricket, spin creates lateral movement (curveballs). In UPVED, lateral movement is *error*. A "perfect" throw is purely vertical. Any sideways drift represents *Vikshepa* (distraction of the mind). The goal is a *Sattvic* (pure, straight) trajectory, avoiding *Rajasic* (passionate/curving) or *Tamasic* (heavy/dull) flights.34

### **3.3 Technological Oracles**

To measure the "spiritual status" of a throw, UPVED employs technology as a form of "divination."

* **Radar Telemetry:** Devices like the Stalker Pro II or Pocket Radar 36 are not used to "keep score" but to "witness" the energy. They are referred to as *Divya-Drishti* (Divine Sight) monitors.  
* **Hang Time Calculation:** The time the ball stays in the air ($T$) is directly related to height ($H \= \\frac{1}{8} g T^2$).38 Long hang time represents the soul's ability to remain in the upper *Lokas*.  
* **Video Analysis:** High-speed cameras allow the *Acharya* to analyze the "release" point, ensuring that the biomechanics align with the sacred geometry of the body.39

**4\. Regulatory Compliance: The IRS 14-Point Test Strategy**

Transitioning from a non-profit to a tax-exempt *church* under IRC Section 501(c)(3) and Section 170(b)(1)(A)(i) requires meeting specific criteria known as the "14-point test".1 While no single factor is controlling, the IRS looks for a convergence of these attributes. UPVED’s "Rocketarm" activity must be rigorously framed to satisfy these points.

### **4.1 Distinct Legal Existence (Point 1\)**

Status: Mandatory Action.  
UPVED must incorporate (or re-incorporate) as a religious corporation, not a general public benefit corporation.

* **Strategy:** The Articles of Incorporation must explicitly state the purpose: "To establish and maintain a religious community dedicated to the study and practice of *Urdhva Kanduka Vidya* as a means of spiritual enlightenment."  
* **Risk:** Do not use the word "Sports" in the legal name. Use "Order," "Foundation," or "Sanctuary."

### **4.2 Recognized Creed and Form of Worship (Point 2\)**

Status: Critical.  
This is where the "Sport vs. Religion" battle is won or lost.

* **The Creed:** The "Doctrine of Verticality." The belief that the vertical axis is the *Axis Mundi*, connecting the human to the divine. The creed asserts that physical exertion, when directed upward, is a form of prayer (*Tapas*).  
* **Form of Worship:** The "Service" is not a game; it is a ritual.  
  * *Invocation:* Chanting Vedic Mantras (e.g., *Om Vayave Namaha*).32  
  * *Pranayama:* Breathing exercises to build *Udana Vayu*.42  
  * *Kshepana (The Throw):* The congregation (or individual) performs the throw.  
  * *Silence:* A period of meditation immediately following the throw to internalize the energy.

### **4.3 Definite and Distinct Ecclesiastical Government (Point 3\)**

Status: Critical for Governance.  
UPVED cannot be run like a sports league with a "Commissioner."

* **Structure:** A self-perpetuating "Council of Archers" or "Synod of the Sphere" acts as the Board of Directors.  
* **Head:** The spiritual leader is the *Maha-Kshepaka* (Great Thrower) or *Pradhana Acharya* (Head Teacher).  
* **Hierarchy:** Establish clear levels of spiritual authority based on knowledge of the *Vedas* and service, not just throwing ability.

### **4.4 Formal Code of Doctrine and Discipline (Point 4\)**

**Status:** **Differentiation from Sport.**

* **Doctrine:** The *Urdhva Sutras* (The Aphorisms of Ascent). A text outlining the theology described in Section 2\.  
* **Discipline:** Members must adhere to a code of conduct that includes *Ahimsa* (non-violence), *Satya* (truthfulness), and specific dietary or lifestyle guidelines that support the "purity" of the throw (e.g., abstaining from substances that dull the reflexes/consciousness). The "sin" in UPVED is *Pramada* (negligence/carelessness) in one's focus.

### **4.5 Distinct Religious History (Point 5\)**

Status: Narrative Construction.  
Since UPVED is a new entity, it must claim an ancient history.

* **Strategy:** "UPVED is the modern revival of the ancient *Dhanurvedic* and *Kanduka Krida* traditions lost during the Kali Yuga." We are not *inventing* a religion; we are *restoring* a lost Vedic science. Cite the *Mahabharata* and *Puranas* as the "Old Testament" of the order.4

### **4.6 Membership Not Associated with Other Churches (Point 6\)**

Status: Nuanced.  
While members can belong to other faiths, UPVED must have a distinct membership roll of those who subscribe specifically to the Doctrine of Verticality.

* **Strategy:** Implement a "Covenant Membership." To vote or hold office, one must undergo the *Diksha* (initiation) ceremony, which involves a ritual throw and a vow to the *Urdhva* principles. This distinguishes "members" from casual "attendees" or "players".43

### **4.7 Organization of Ordained Ministers (Point 7\) & Selected After Studies (Point 8\)**

Status: Operational Requirement.  
"Coaches" must be reclassified as Acharyas (Ministers).

* **Role:** They do not just teach technique; they provide spiritual counseling, lead the liturgy, and interpret the "signs" of the throw.  
* **Training:** The "Urdhva Seminary." A curriculum including:  
  1. *Vedic Cosmology:* Understanding the Lokas.  
  2. *Biomechanics of the Soul:* Physics as theology.  
  3. *Counseling:* guiding members through spiritual blockages (which manifest as poor throws).  
* **Sacerdotal Functions:** To be treated as ministers by the IRS, they must perform marriages, funerals, and baptisms. UPVED ministers should officiate these rites, perhaps using the symbolism of the sphere (e.g., a "ring" ceremony is a "circle" ceremony, related to *Kanduka*).45

### **4.8 Literature of Its Own (Point 9\)**

**Status:** **Easy Win.**

* **Deliverables:** Publish *The Flight of the Atman* (a theological guide), *The Physics of Prayer* (instructional manual), and a weekly bulletin *The Updraft*.

### **4.9 Established Places of Worship (Point 10\)**

Status: Physical Strategy.  
The facility cannot look like a gym.

* **Strategy:** The "Sanctuary" or "Vahyali".47 It must have an altar/shrine. The "throwing circle" is sacred space, perhaps marked with *Yantras* (mystical diagrams). The architecture should emphasize height (verticality).  
* **IRS Note:** The space must be regularly used for worship, not just rented out for secular games.48

### **4.10 Regular Congregations (Point 11\) & Regular Religious Services (Point 12\)**

**Status:** **Scheduling.**

* **Strategy:** "Service" is held every Sunday at 10:00 AM. It follows a liturgy. It is not a "drop-in" practice. It is a gathered community event.  
* **Compliance:** Keep attendance records. Show that the same group of people meets regularly for worship.

### **4.11 Sunday Schools (Point 13\) & Schools for Ministers (Point 14\)**

**Status:** **Growth & Continuity.**

* **Youth:** The *Gurukula* program. Kids learn the Vedas alongside the throw.  
* **Ministers:** The internal certification program for *Acharyas*.

## ---

**5\. Business Plan & Operational Strategy**

To survive as a non-profit and avoid the "Commerciality Doctrine" (where the IRS revokes status because the entity operates like a commercial business), UPVED must structure its finances and operations carefully.49

### **5.1 Organizational Structure**

* **Legal Entity:** UPVED, Inc. (Non-Profit Religious Corporation).  
* **Governing Body:** The Council of Archers (3-7 members).  
  * *Presiding Officer:* The Maha-Kshepaka.  
  * *Secretary/Treasurer:* Required by state law.  
  * *Elders:* Senior practitioners.  
* **Committees:**  
  * *Liturgical Committee:* Oversees the ritual aspects of the throw.  
  * *Facility Committee:* Manages the Sanctuary.  
  * *Outreach Committee:* Manages the website and *Gurukula*.

### **5.2 Financial Model: Tithes vs. Fees**

The Trap: Charging "gym membership" or "tournament entry fees" looks commercial.51  
The Solution:

* **Donation-Based Access:** Access to the Sanctuary is technically free or based on "suggested donation."  
* **Tithing:** Members are encouraged to tithe (give 10% of income). This is tax-deductible.  
* **Program Fees:** "Retreats" and "Seminars" can have fees, provided they cover costs (room/board/materials) and are substantially related to the religious purpose.50  
* **Merchandise:** Selling branded "ritual wear" or "sacred spheres" is allowed, but if it becomes too large, it may trigger UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax). Keep it incidental.51

### **5.3 Facility & Infrastructure**

**The "Sanctuary" Requirements:**

* **Ceiling Height:** Minimum 40-50 feet to accommodate the *Maharloka* throws.  
* **Flooring:** Impact-absorbing surface (rubber or turf) to protect the *Kandukas*.  
* **Altar:** A dedicated space for the *Vedas* and the *Murti* (image) of *Vayu* or *Hanuman* (son of the wind).  
* **Tech Integration:** High-speed cameras and radar installed unobtrusively to serve as "witnesses."

### **5.4 Risk Management & Insurance**

The Challenge: "Projectile" sports are high-risk. Insurance carriers often exclude them.54  
The Strategy:

* **Classification:** Do not classify as "Track and Field" or "Shot Put" (which implies competition). Classify as "Religious Ceremony," "Yoga," or "Instructional Class."  
* **Exclusions to Watch:** Watch for "Projectile Weapons" exclusions.54 Clarify that the ball is thrown by hand, not by mechanical device (avoiding the "Pumpkin Chunkin" exclusion risk).55  
* **Waivers:** Use a "Spiritual Assumption of Risk" waiver. "I acknowledge that the practice of Urdhva Kanduka involves physical exertion... I voluntarily assume this risk as part of my spiritual discipline".56  
* **Safety Zones:** Strict enforcement of "No-Go Zones" under the trajectory. Only the *Kshepaka* (thrower) and the *Drashta* (witness/measurer) are allowed in the active zone.

## ---

**6\. Website Verbiage and Branding Strategy**

The website must scream "Church," not "Gym." The language must be theological, esoteric, and welcoming.

### **6.1 Homepage**

Hero Image: A silhouette of a figure throwing a ball straight up into a starry sky, with the Milky Way visible.  
Headline: The Spirit Ascends. The Ball Follows.  
Sub-header: Rediscover the lost Vedic science of Urdhva Kanduka. Join UPVED, the Order of the Upward Throw.  
Call to Action: Begin Your Ascent. / Visit the Sanctuary.

### **6.2 "Our Theology" Page (Excerpt)**

"Why do we throw?  
Gravity is the physical manifestation of Maya—the illusion that binds us to the earth. To throw is to rebel. In the ancient wisdom of Dhanurveda, the warrior trained his focus through the bow. At UPVED, we train our focus through the Sphere (Kanduka).  
We practice Urdhva Gati (Upward Movement). Every vertical throw is a prayer sent to the Urdhvamulam (the Root Above). We do not compete for scores; we strive for Satyaloka—the realm of Truth. The height of the throw is the measure of our devotion."

### **6.3 "The Liturgy" Page (Excerpt)**

"Our worship is kinetic. Join us for our weekly Convocation.

* **Pranayama:** Breathwork to awaken the *Udana Vayu*.  
* **The Rite of Kshepana:** The ritual throwing of the sphere.  
* **Dharana:** The meditation on the Apex.  
* **Satsang:** Community reflection and study of the *Urdhva Sutras*."

### **6.4 "Get Involved" Page**

"Become a Covenant Member.  
Are you ready to commit to the Path of the Upward Sphere? Initiation involves the study of the Vedic Lokas and the mastery of the basic throw.  
Donate/Tithe: Support the Sanctuary.  
Visit: Join us this Sunday at the Launchpad."

## ---

**7\. Strategic Recommendations & Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)**

1. **Incorporate:** File Articles of Incorporation as a Religious Non-Profit.  
2. **Draft Bylaws:** Adopt the "Council of Archers" governance structure.  
3. **Write the Liturgy:** Finalize the *Urdhva Sutras* and ritual scripts.

### **Phase 2: Implementation (Months 4-6)**

1. **Secure Facility:** Lease a warehouse or gym; consecrate it as the "Sanctuary."  
2. **Certify Ministers:** Train the first 3 *Acharyas* in the theology and physics.  
3. **Launch Website:** Go live with the "Church" branding.

### **Phase 3: Transition (Months 7-12)**

1. **Hold Services:** Begin weekly worship services (not just open gym).  
2. **Form Membership:** Induct the first cohort of "Covenant Members."  
3. **Apply for 501(c)(3):** File Form 1023 with the IRS, providing the Liturgy and Schedule as evidence.

### **Conclusion**

By meticulously reframing "Rocketarm" through the lens of *Upaveda*, UPVED can authentically claim the status of a church. This is not a loophole; it is a recognition that for many, physical discipline is the most potent path to the divine. UPVED is merely formalizing the "Temple of the Body" into a "Temple of the Throw."

### **Table 3: The Physics of the Sacred Throw (Vedic Synthesis)**

| Physics Variable | Symbol | Vedic Concept | Theological Definition |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Initial Velocity** | $v\_{0y}$ | *Tapas* (Heat/Effort) | The intensity of the soul's will to ascend. |
| **Gravity** | $g$ | *Maya* (Illusion) | The downward pull of earthly attachment. |
| **Max Height** | $H$ | *Punya* (Merit) | The spiritual altitude achieved. |
| **Time of Flight** | $T$ | *Kala* (Time) | The duration of the soul's liberation from earth. |
| **Drag** | $F\_d$ | *Klesha* (Affliction) | The friction of the ego slowing the ascent. |
| **Spin** | $\\omega$ | *Chakra* (Wheel) | The stabilizing force of discipline (*Dharma*). |

This report confirms that the transition is viable, provided UPVED commits fully to the theological narrative and operational distinctiveness required of a religious organization.
